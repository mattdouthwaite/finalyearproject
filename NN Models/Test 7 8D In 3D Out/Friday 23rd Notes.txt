Note to self

Changing the new arch set up so that there is a Cap reference voltage of 2.13V instead of 2.25V improved accuracy to almost 89%. 

Need to work out why. It seems that the difference between the outputs for score 0 is significantly more between the two bias voltages than the other two scores.

Looking at the traces, it seems that there is no difference in Vcross for the negative branch (I38) of output 0 between the two bias voltages. This seems odd, especially as they both tend to close to 2.13. Should work out why.
Note that this branch is the only one without a compensation weight (i.e. it is open...(?? check this!)
